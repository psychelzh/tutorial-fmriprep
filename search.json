    "text": "Introduction of BIDS\nBrain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a simple and intuitive way to organize and describe your neuroimaging and behavioral data (official site: https://bids.neuroimaging.io/). Why BIDS? (Source: https://rpubs.com/sarenseeley/bids-fmriprep-mriqc)\n\nHeterogeneity in how complex data are organized can lead to confusion (including within-lab as well as between-lab), and unnecessary manual metadata input.\nResearchers can take advantage of the numerous and ever-expanding library of “BIDS apps”, or software packages that are written to take valid BIDS datasets as input.\nAvoids the need for highly study- or lab-specific pipelines, improves reproducibility for the field as a whole, we can be more confident in our results.\nThe ability to automatically validate a dataset allows you to spot issues (files missing or in the wrong place, inconsistent naming, etc.) and makes curation easier and faster.\nHaving a standardized format facilitates data reuse/sharing (benefits for cost-effectiveness of research $)."
