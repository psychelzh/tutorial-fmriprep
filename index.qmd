# BIDS

## Introduction of BIDS {.smaller}

Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a simple and intuitive way to organize and describe your neuroimaging and behavioral data (official site: <https://bids.neuroimaging.io/>). Why BIDS? (Source: <https://rpubs.com/sarenseeley/bids-fmriprep-mriqc>)

-   Heterogeneity in how complex data are organized can lead to confusion (including within-lab as well as between-lab), and unnecessary manual metadata input.

-   Researchers can take advantage of the numerous and ever-expanding library of "BIDS apps", or software packages that are written to take valid BIDS datasets as input.

-   Avoids the need for highly study- or lab-specific pipelines, improves reproducibility for the field as a whole, we can be more confident in our results.

-   The ability to automatically validate a dataset allows you to spot issues (files missing or in the wrong place, inconsistent naming, etc.) and makes curation easier and faster.

-   Having a standardized format facilitates data reuse/sharing (benefits for cost-effectiveness of research \$).

## BIDS Basics

## Convert from DICOM to BIDS {.smaller}

HeuDiConv: <https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

> a heuristic-centric DICOM converter

-   Essentially, it requires us prepare a so-called `heuristic` file, which is a python script that tells the tool how to convert the DICOM files to BIDS format.
-   Typically, we could let the tool generate a template `heuristic` file for us, and then we can modify it to fit our needs.
-   It should be very easy, but the details can be tricky. Read [these tutorials](https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html).

## Recommended practices {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Use docker container (convert to singularity if on server)
-   Three-step process:
    -   Do a dry-run of HeuDiConv on a sample subject to generate heuristic file and data sequence info files
    -   Modify heuristic file based on the DICOM characteristics listed in `.heudiconv/dicominfo.tsv` file
    -   Run HeuDiConv using the revised heuristic file
-   The `heuristic` file requires some `python` programming skills
-   Plan the protocol names when you collect the data

# fMRIPrep

## What is fMRIPrep?

![Overview of the whole picture](images/clipboard-2988983619.png)

## Outputs of fMRIPrep

A BIDS derivatives dataset of the form:

```         
<output_dir>/
  logs/
  sub-<label>/
  sub-<label>.html
  dataset_description.json
```

-   Derivatives data is in `sub-<label>/` folder, including anatomical, freesurfer [^1] and functional derivatives
-   Visual report is genrated as `sub-<label>.html`, [here is a sample report](https://fmriprep.org/en/latest/_static/SampleReport/sample_report.html)
-   `dataset_description.json` is a a metadata file in which fMRIPrep records metadata recommended by the BIDS standard
-   The confounds of each BOLD results are also stored in derivatives data, but note fMRIPrep only generates them, not uses them to denoise data

## Recommended practices {.smaller}

-   Use the newest stable version because it is constantly updated
-   Download `TemplateFlow` data beforehand to avoid network issues
-   Run each subject separately and run all in parallel
-   Possible issue: now `--use-aroma` is removed, ICA is not done (maybe not so necessary)
